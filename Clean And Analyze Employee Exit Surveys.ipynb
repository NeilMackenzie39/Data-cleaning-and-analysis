    "The goal of this guided project is to clean and then analyse data about from two Australian government departments to identify the reasons for resignations. Data will be analysed for employees from the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. \n",

    "Although these datasets contain similar information for employees from each department, the method of recording and/or reporting them is different. The datasets will therefore need to be standardized before being combined for comparison.\n",

    "The instruction for this project is to assume the role of data analyst and pretend that stakeholders would like answers to the following questions\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",

    "The reason for DETE and TAFE employee resignations was successfully analysed during this project. A significant amount of data cleaning was required to reach a point where each dataset contained the required columns so that the datasets could be combined or analysis. Once combined, the number and percentage of employees that resigned due to dissatisfaction was determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Employees who resigned due to dissatisfaction were categorised by their length of service (experience) to answer the following question: \n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "\n",
    "The experience categories used for this analysis are shown in the table below\n",

    "|New|Less than 3 years \n",

    "|Experienced|Between 7 and 10 years\n",
    "|Veteran|11 or More years|\n",
    "\n",
    "The chart above indicates that employees with 7 or more years of experience are more likely to resign due to dissatisfaction than less experienced employees. This is especially true for veteran employees as 95% of them who retired did so due to some kind of dissatisfaction\n"
